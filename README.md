Grade 12 culminating task created by Philip Scott and Geoff Hasko. Displays phone specifications when user enters a phone model. Keep in mind that phone scores are arbitrary, and were assigned by PhoneMaster Geoff. Phone specs were retrieved manually from other sites and are stored in PHP scripts. If the database is ever cleared, the PHP scripts containing the queries can be re-run to reconstruct the database.

Teacher stressed modular practices, hence the extensive use of external files. At the time, we were unaware that having many external files would cause lag as a result of many HTTP requests, so please have mercy :p

The file paths are rather quirky, and may not work on your computer. If you want to see the site in action without installing XAMPP, you're in luck! Visit phonefaceoff.io
